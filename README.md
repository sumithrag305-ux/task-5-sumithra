# 📊 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using Python.
It includes data loading, cleaning, visualization, summary statistics, and insights that explain the survival patterns of passengers.

## 📌 **Key EDA Steps**

### 🔹 1. Data Understanding

* Checked dataset shape, data types, and previewed records.

### 🔹 2. Univariate Analysis

* Age Distribution
* Fare Distribution
* Pclass Distribution
* Survival Count

### 🔹 3. Bivariate Analysis

* Survival vs Gender
* Survival vs Pclass
* Survival vs Age
* Survival vs Fare

### 🔹 4. Multivariate Analysis

* Pairplot between Age, Fare, Pclass, Survival

### 🔹 5. Correlation Analysis

* Heatmap showing relationships between numerical features

## 📈 **Key Findings**

* **Females survived significantly more** than males.
* **1st class passengers** had the highest survival rate.
* **Higher fare** → greater chance of survival.
* **Age** showed weaker correlation with survival.
* **Family size features (SibSp & Parch)** show moderate correlation.
